# Artificial Intelligence Based Shape Representation  
*A Workshop by bbiox lab*

## Overview

This workshop explores deep learning (DL) methods for shape representation in medical imaging, emphasizing reproducibility through Git and GitHub. Participants will learn how to build and adapt neural networks for analyzing anatomical structures and how to manage research code using version control.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand CNNs and key DL components (layers, loss functions, optimizers)
- Explore and implement advanced DL architectures for shape modeling
- Use GitHub for collaborative, version-controlled code development

## Workshop Structure
  - Shape fundamentals *(Lecture)*  
  - State-of-the-art DL models *(Lecture)*  
  - Testing models with a visual foundation architecture and other architectures *(Lecture + Hands-on)*
  - Git & GitHub essentials *(Lecture)*  

## Audience

Designed for:
- PhD students & early-career researchers using DL in medical/biomechanical modeling
- Researchers seeking improved reproducibility and version control workflows

##  Requirements
